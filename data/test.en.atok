hi . frank . . . coming in please .
right . just a sec .
okay .
dave if you ve a minute i d like your advice on something .
sure what is it ?
well it s nothing really important but it s annoying .
what s up ?
it s about my salary cheques .
yes ?
interesting that you mention it because i ve got the same problem .
really .
it s possible .
well what do you think we ought to do about it ?
i don t think we should make any fuss about it yet . i m sure they ll straighten it out .
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training .
i suppose the idea was specialized training .
i suppose so . though of course there s a more sinister explanation .
oh ?
yes . you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check out .
i don t know . all i heard is that there s something about the mission we weren t told .
that seems very unlikely .
yes i thought so .
of course it would be very easy for us to find out now .
how ?
just ask hal . it s conceivable they might keep something from us but they d never keep anything from hal .
yes but it s to fantastic to think that they d keep something from us .
i know . it would be almost inconceivable .
but not completely inconceivable ?
i suppose it isn t logically impossible .
i guess it isn t .
well that s something .
yes i don t know what to make of it .
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong .
yes but it s more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low .
good morning . how s it going ?
are you reasonably awake ?
oh i m fine i m wide awake . what s up ?
well . . . hal s reported the ao unit about to fail again .
you re kidding .
i don t know . hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure .
two units in four days . how many spares do we have ?
two more .
hal ?
i didn t do that frank . i took particular care not to freeze them .
i guess you don t know your own strength old boy .
i guess not .
i think i ll have to go out and burn them off .
i m sorry frank but i don t think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know .
sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think we ve got a problem .
what is it hal ?
the unit is still operational dave . but it will fail within seventy two hours .
not now hal i d like to talk to you about something .
sure dave what s up ?
you know that we checked the two ao units that you reported in imminent failure condition ?
yes i know .
you probably also know that we found them okay .
i m not questioning your word dave but it s just not possible . i m not capable of being wrong .
i m sorry about the misunderstanding hal .
well don t worry about it .
and don t you worry about it .
is your confidence in me fully restored ?
yes it is hal .
too bad about frank isn t it ?
yes it is .
the antenna has to be replaced .
i m goin to do this myself hal . let me have the control please .
look dave your ve probably got a lot to do . i suggest you leave it to me .

mommy s out to the hair dresser .
where is mrs . brown ?
she s in the bathroom .

how many days until you come home ?
okay sweetheart . have a lovely birthday party tomorrow .
thank you daddy .
i ll wish you a happy birthday now and i ll see you soon . all right darling ?
yes daddy .
bye bye now sweetheart .
oh thank you very much .
thank you .
well i ve heard more and more people talk of an epidemic .
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later .
i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty .
and your charming little daughter ?
oh she s growing up very fast . as a matter of fact she s six tomorrow .
oh that s such a delightful age .
how is gregor ?
he s fine . but i m afraid we don t get a chance to see each other very much these days .
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal .
are you sure you won t change your mind about a drink ?
no thank you . . . and i m afraid now i really must be going .
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you .
well thank you very much for being so understanding .
please it really doesn t matter .
well . . did you have a pleaant flight ?
yes very pleasant .
well shall we go through documentation ?
yes i think so . just about then .
i suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking .
are you quite sure ?
well as it happens i m on my way up to the moon
are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius ?
i m sorry but i m not sure i know what you mean .
well it s just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius .
yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but it s been going on for the past ten days .
you mean you haven t been able to get anyone at the base for ten days ?
that s right .
yes . . . well i hope the crew got back safely .
fortunately they did .
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr . floyd . we should be given all the facts .
yes it does . the sub surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago .
how can you tell it was deliberately buried ?
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill .
but you don t have any idea as to what it is ?
has it been exposed to any sun before now ?
oh marvellous . it s the first real sleep i ve had for the past two days .
there s nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest .
when do we arrive at clavius ?
we re scheduled to dock in about seven hours . is there anything we can do for you ?
thank you .
incidentally dr . floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements ?
i see .
well fine . thanks very much anyway and i hope you don t mind me asking ?
no of course captain i can understand your concern .
right . hal tell me whether the following statements are true or false .
i will if i can frank .
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn . true or false ?
true .
our transit time is days . is that true ?
that s true .
hal have pod arms secure the component .
five by five frank .
hal i m going out now to replace the a .o . unit .
i understand .
hal maintain normal e .v .a . condition .
roger .
pod bay is decompressed . all doors are secure . you are free to open pod bay doors .
yes hal what s up ?
i know you did frank but i assure you there was an impending failure .
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault ?
not really frank . i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure .
yeah ?
name ?
this is three years old .
we don t wash em ya know .
how about chargin the battery ?
that we do . and we put air in the tires . i ll even sell you some gas if you need it .

get ready . we shove off as soon as griff reports all the crew aboard .
is there any way out of it ?
seems to be all around . . .
what about down ?
course and speed ?
a mass of jelly like stuff came out of the thing and caught our torpedo !
what course skipper ?
you better take powell and carney with you
the frogmen ?
with their underwater experience they ll be invaluable . take sidearms and flare pistols
sidearms ? but the saucer s dead .
excuse me skipper
yes griff ?
skipper could you take a look here . . . ?
something wrong ?
the inertial navigation system . must have been knocked out in the crash .
why do you say that ?
we re dead in the water . but it indicates we re moving !
we read you ! go ahead doctor ! they re inside the saucer . it s filled with breathable air !
wonderful !
now they feel it . . .down below .
excuse me captain there may be one last desperate chance a one in a thousand shot . . .
it doesn t seem possible but could it be an electrical storm center ?
under u water u ?
. . .above murmansk and finland .
suppose our theorizing is correct ? then this u could u be the next danger point !
the radiation level from the saucer it s rising !
as we near the pole . . .
there s got to be an explanation !
all ready ?
i m afraid i have some bad news for you reef you ll have to share quarters this trip .
who with ?
doctor neilsen ? when did u that u happen ?
huh ?
what do you think ?
determine extent of damage immediately .
you re sure it s cyclops ?
what s the running time ?
right u at u him ?
that s what i said !
but what can we accomplish ?
suppose there s an atmosphere of some kind inside cyclops ?
what ?
straight to the pole at almost fifty knots !
what s the corrected bearing to the magnetic pole ?
remove your weapons commander . and come here alone !
that s a u face u ? ? ?
point of view is everything . to us u your u form of life is ugly as we appear to you .
my mission is to study various solar systems and planets select the most suitable for colonization
swell !
he did !
why not me ? what am i the closing act ?
on the contrary . i want you unharmed perfect .
it is a living thing . when damaged you would say wounded it immediately heals itself .
that s why no water leaked inside when we rammed you ?
to navigate won t you have to . . . see your way ?
obviously .
my yeoman will show you to your quarters .
well i ll be !
we ve asked ourselves that over and over a thousand times .
due north . at five knots . . .no six !
cyclops will have to linger at the pole to recharge his power banks .

twombley .
no shit .
you think jack shot him ?
well it was an accident .
lillian was here . in lawford .
huh ?
the night before the shooting .
how was she ?

who ?
jill . i was thinking of getting a lawyer . maybe you can help me .
what happened ?
don t think about it . you re exhausted .
yeah i guess .
haven t you already done a bit of that ?
pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do i guess .
anyone else want one ? rolfe ?
no thanks . i don t drink .
what about margie ?
what about her ?
anything new about the shooting ? twombley ?
i guess it was an accident like everybody thinks .
find them everywhere .
i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one .
which is ?
that it wasn t an accident .
then who shot him ?
well your friend i think . jack hewitt .
motive . you gotta have a motive .
money .
who d pay him that kind of money ? not the mob . they got their own guys . specialists .
they wouldn t deal with a guy like jack . who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead ?
so mel gordon wouldn t want a professional hit . that d make the feds dig deeper . he wants an accident .
not particularly .
right s right goddamnit ! don t you care what s right ?
i was thinking about that story you told me about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after .
yeah .
i hate to disappoint you but i don t think it happened .
of course it happened . why would i lie about it ?
it may have happened but not the way you said .
we d have to go digging in vietnam to ask him .
and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft .
i know what it means . i m just running out of ways to use it .
it s not like he hasn t made us wait a few times .

the pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet .

they aren t answering their hails .
they ve got no chutes . they can t control the plane their engines are failing and they re losing fuel .
i prefered the terrorists .
it was a good ad lib sir .
the iraqi ambassador is claiming it s just an exercise .
general greely says it looks like the middle east .
can we do that ?
they still have the president it s past their deadline and they haven t called . what do you think it means ?
if challenged our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission .
iraqi s won t buy it . either they re already in on this or they ll think we re spying .
the chief justice ? what on earth for ?
special agent gibbs . you helped do this ?
yes mr . president .

we checked the manifest . everyone was accounted for .
remarkable aircraft . remarkable .

you re pointing a gun at me .
fear will keep you alive . any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish and bound to die .
now or he dies please .
leave my daughter alone .
or you will do what mrs . marshall ? but i admire your courage . your husband on the other hand . . .
what do you know of my husband ?
i know he left you behind .
do you have to be so brutal ?
yes
why ? do you enjoy it ?
i neither enjoy nor dislike . i do what is necessary .
that was war .
shall i begin by executing the president s daughter ? she s right here .
no .
nor will there be . my husband does not negotiate with terrorists .
the world is such a dangerous place and we can t always protect our children .
four . . .
jim . . .

she isn t a part of this . this is between you and me .
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists .
stop .
you ll do it ?
yes i ll do it . just leave my family alone .
the taste of defeat is bitter no ?

what would you say if i told you the toilet just blew up in my face .
elaine !
ted !

my career is shot .
simon i didn t want it to end like this . we can be friends ! you ll die out there .
maybe .
elaine ask rok for a field interference scan . those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications .
i don t think we have any alternative captain .
i see . what do you think our alternatives are ?
roger .
you can do it from up here captain .
i d rather sit down for this one elaine .
no i mean you can do it from the cockpit .
intermitant failure in scan mode r . analyze .
negative .
that doesn t make sense . repeat analysis .

i am sorry madame but i have my orders .
i am sorry madame but no ! i cannot let anyone pass .
upstairs .
gertrude !
i ve heard about you for ages ! i thought you must be an old man .
gertrude !
it s such an honour for us to have you here herr mozart . and for gertrude .
i said play !
what a strange young man .
really ?
perhaps a little refreshment first ? a little coffee or a little chocolate ?
i d like a little wine if you have it .
just one year .
who was your teacher ?
i was . but she quite outgrew the little i could show her .
what a charming idea . may i see ?
it s just a trifle of course .
may i try it ?
delightful court composer . would you permit me to play it as he comes in ?
you do me too much honour sire .
a flat majesty .
and here is our illustrious court composer herr salieri .
well i m glad to hear that .
excuse me sire but what do you think these could be ? being a foreigner i would love to learn .
good morning court composer . this is my niece the princess elizabeth .
oh your majesty it would be such a tremendous honour !
an interesting idea majesty . but
yes ?
you already commissioned an opera from mozart .
and the result satisfies .
yes of course . my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism .
you please me court composer . a very clever idea .
sire .
i don t think you understand me court composer .
majesty i did . believe me it was a most agonizing . decision . but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart .
majesty i don t like to talk against a fellow musician .
of course not .
i have to tell you mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies .
really ?
as a matter of fact one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well !
yes ?
do you like this salieri ?
it is not a question of liking your majesty . your own law decrees it i m afraid .
oh thank you .
the director of our opera . count orsini rosenberg .
and now he has returned the compliment . herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you .
majesty !
why so ?
well what is it about ? tell us the story .
yes where ?
in a pasha s harem majesty . a seraglio .
keep it sire if you want to . it is already here in my head .

it is new it is isn t it sire ?
yes indeed .
and german ?
oh yes . absolutely . german . unquestionably !
what do you mean sire ?
majesty this is madame weber . she is my landlady .
really ? how delightful . may i ask when you marry ?
excuse me but how old are you ?
twenty six .
bravo mozart . most charming . yes indeed . clever man .
majesty may i ask you to do me the greatest favour ?
mozart are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre ?
yes sire .
yet we hear you are making an opera from it . is this true ?
who told you this majesty ?
it is not your place to ask questions . is it true ?
well yes i admit it is .
would you tell me why ?
but majesty this is just a frolic . it s a piece about love .
i have no idea .
guess ! guess majesty . imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it .
well six or seven minutes ! maybe eight !
forgive me majesty . i m a vulgar man . but i assure you my music is not .
you are passionate mozart ! but you do not persuade .
ah ha . what do you say chamberlain ?

good morning fraulein schlumberg .
never mind strudel . it s part of music getting used to an audience . aren t i right herr mozart ?
herr mozart . what a surprise . what can i do for you ?
is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music ?
well your pupil is married and living in mannheim young man .
really ? perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction ?
what is this mozart ? what s the matter with you ?
well . since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services could you favour me with a little money instead ?
what for ?
if a man cannot earn he must borrow .
well this is hardly the way to go about it .
i m sorry . no .
please . i ll give it back i promise . please sir .
i know your work well signore . do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours ?
really ?
mio caro adone .
ah !
love sire !
yes ! yes ! er on the whole yes majesty .
dear mozart my sincere congratulations .
did you like it then ?
how could i not ?
i m flattered . and congratulations to you of course .
why ? here is the music . it s here . i am submitting it humbly . isn t that what you wanted ?
my dear mozart there is no one in the world i would rather help but now it is too late .
whom did they choose ?
herr sommer .
sommer ? herr sommer ? but the man s a fool ! he s a total mediocrity .
look i must have pupils . without pupils i can t manage .
you don t mean to tell me you are living in poverty ?
no but i m broke . i m always broke . i don t know why .
it has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means .
how can anyone say that ? we have no cook no maid . we have no footman . nothing at all !
of course not .
do you have a daughter ?
ah how exciting ! tell me more .
i d better not . it s a bit of a secret .
come come mozart i m interested . truly .
actually it s a big secret . oh this is delicious ! what is it ?
cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum . crema al mascarpone .
ah . italian ?
forgive me . we all have patriotic feelings of some kind .
two thousand two hundred florins is all i need a hundred ? fifty ?
what exactly are you working on ?
wolfgang what is it ? sta calmo per favore . what s the matter ?
it s unbelievable ! the director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music . pages of it .
you burned the score ?
oh no ! my wife took it out in time .
how fortunate .
it s not fair that a man like that has power over our work .
but there are those who have power over him . i think i ll take this up with the emperor .
oh excellency would you ?
with all my heart mozart .
nine performances ! nine ! that s all it s had and withdrawn .
i know it s outrageous . still if the public doesn t like one s work one has to accept the fact gracefully .
what did you think of it yourself ? did you like it at all ?
i think it s marvelous . truly .
oh no the honour would be all mine .
grazie mio caro wolfgang !
mozart . it was good of you to come .
how could i not ?
did my work please you ?
how could it not excellency ?
yes ?
i never knew that music like that was possible .
you flatter me .
i have come to commission work from you .
what work ?
a mass for the dead .
what dead ? who is dead ?
a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one .
who are you ?
i am only a messenger . do you accept ? you will be paid well .
how long will you give me ?
i don t have it yet . it s not finished . i m sorry but i need more time .
are you neglecting my request ?
what happened ? is it over ?
i m taking you home . you re not well .
where is your wife ?
not here ! she s not well either . she went to the spa .
you mean she s not coming back ?
you re so good to me . truly . thank you .
no please .
i would never miss anything that you had written . you must know that .
do you mean that ?
i do .
i have bad fancies . i don t sleep well anymore . then i drink too much and think stupid things .
are you ill ?
the doctor thinks i am . but
what ?
shall i answer it ?
no ! no it s him !
